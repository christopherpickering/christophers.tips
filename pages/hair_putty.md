## Instructions

First setup a double boiler. I like to put a jar lid inside a pot of boiling water and then put a small measuring cup in there. Starting out with pre-boiling water from the kettle helps to speed things up.

Add all ingredients in, except the essential oils. Save then for the end.

Melt everything together. After its all melted and stirred together, add the essential oils. Give it one more quick stir and then pour out into containers.

Try not to burn your hands.

Quickly put the new putty into the freezer to cool off.

## Final Tips

Shea butter will sometimes "peletize" or feel like little crumbles when the temperature changes. Putting it in the freezer helps to stop this from happeneing. It sounds like the temp where this happens is 75Â°.

Sometimes the putty will all of a sudden become grainy after a few months. Just stick it in the microwave for a minute or two until it has all melted.. mix and stick it back in the freezer for an hour to solidify. Have fun!

To us the putty, just rub it around in your fingers until it is pretty soft.. then put your hands in your hair like doing shampoo. I think you probably get the idea...
