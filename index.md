# Hi, I'm Christopher Pickering

I'm a believer in Jesus Christ and an engineer. I love my family, learning, building things, and solving hard problems.

## What I do

I work for [Bimba](www.bimba.com) during the day. Most of my time is spent creating solutions and simplifying tasks with python programming and doing data collection, reporting and analysis.  

When other time is available I chip in at [Dayspring Bibles](www.dayspringbibles.com) doing scripting, typesetting and other fun things.

## This Site

This is a static html site built with markdown and compiled with python. You can learn how to make it [here](/pages/make_this_site.html). I've found that most of the time used on projects is spent finding a simple problem. The purpose of this site is to save the little solutions for next time :)

**Thanks for visiting.**
